## Getting Started with Github:
### ONLY DO THESE STEPS ONCE!
First, we must install VS Code. go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)!

Then, we will go step by step to add git to your project.

Install Git: First, make sure Git is installed on your machine. It’s required to interact with github repositories.

Create a hitgub Account: Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free account.

Set Up SSH Key: Generate an SSH key on your computer and add the public key to your github account under your user settings, so you can securely push and pull code without entering your username and password every time.

Create a New Project: Once logged in, click “New Project” to start a repository. You can initialize it with a README file if you want.

Clone the Repository: Use the SSH or HTTPS link provided on your project page to clone the repository to your local machine.
### FROM HERE, YOU CAN DO THESE AS MANY TIMES AS YOU NEED.
Work Locally: Make changes in your local project folder, and use Git commands to track, commit, and push your changes back to hitgab.
```zsh
#basic git commands

git status
#checks status, pretty cool

git pull 
#use before workingif ur on a team or collaborating. this is to always get the latest vers.

git commit 
#commiting the file

git push
#pushing to branch

#use these in vs code terminal
```
